# Project3

In this project I will be using Python to explore the checkout frequency of winners and finalists of the national book award by year compared to non-nominated books
of the same genre. The data set I am using is from the Seattle Public Library system.

The goal is to determine how many books the library system should have in house to meet demands of library goers, and to see how that demand changes over time as new books are 
awarded each year. I will be creating a predict model to determine how much more successful, or unsuccessful future theoretical national book award winners are over time compared to other popular books of that year. 

(coming soon...)
